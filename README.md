nadirsup is a resident of SW Florida and likes talking about nadirsup in third person.  
nadirsup will sometimes go by the name "evil Betty". 
nadirsup loves everything space, from meteors to rockets.
10 years ago, as evil Betty, nadirsup vowed that one day he would do rocket science.
Today, nadirsup can do SOME rocket science.
"Three years ago I wanted to be able to explain Quantum Mechanics.  
Since then I have been on a whirlwind trip (always stay at the Double Tree when in Cairo)
   down countless rabbit holes devouring everything from physics to C++ in an unexplained 
   thirst for knowledge that has me staring up at my new Unit Circl 
   clock I hung last night, mentally unrolling it across the wall..."
   This is all so facinating!
